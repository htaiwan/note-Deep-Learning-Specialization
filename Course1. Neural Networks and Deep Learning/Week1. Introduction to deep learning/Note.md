#  Introduction to deep learning

## What is a neural network?
> * It is a powerful learning algorithm inspired by how the brain works.
> * **single neural network**

## Supervised Learning with Neural Networks
> * **supervised learning**, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.
> * Supervised learning problems are categorized into **"regression" and "classification"** problems.
> * **regression problem**, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function.
> * **classification problem**, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.

## Why is Deep Learning taking off?
> * Deep learning is taking off due to a **large amount of data available** through the digitization of the society, **faster computation** and **innovation in the development of neural network algorithm**.
